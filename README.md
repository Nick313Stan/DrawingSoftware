# Wacky Drawing Software

## Introduction

Welcome to **Wacky Drawing Software**, a project I've worked on for a month. This is my first venture into using C++ and OpenGL, and I'm excited to share it with you. This software serves as a testament to my learning journey, and I hope it inspires others.
